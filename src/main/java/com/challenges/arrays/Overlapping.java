/* Merge Overlapping Intervalsâ€¢
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of arbitrary intervals,merges any overlapping intervals,and returns the new intervals in no particular order.Each interval interval is an array of two integers,with interval[0]as the start of the interval and interval[1]as the end of the interval.Note that back-to-back intervals aren'tconsidered to be overlapping.For example,[1,5]and[6,7]aren't overlapping;however,[1,6]and[6,7]are indeed overlapping.
Also note that the start of any particular interval will always be less than or equal to the end of that interval.

Sample Input
int[][] intervals = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 5 }, { 4, 7 }, { 6, 8 }, { 9, 10 } };

Sample Output
{{1,2},{3,8},{9,10}}

Merge the intervals [3, 5], [4, 7], and [6, 8].
The intervals could be ordered differently. */
